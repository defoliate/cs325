Q:What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of quicksort. Briefly explain each case.
A:
best-case: the list is given by the order that we want. the only thing to do is to sacn the rest list and iterate, the complexity is o(nlogn).
anverage-case: the list is random, the complexity should be accumulated in Math Expectited value. the complexity is o(nlogn).
worst-case: the list is sorted by the averse order that we should sort from top to the bottom list. the complexity is o(n^2).

Q: What's the best-case, worst-case, and average-case time complexities of
quickselect? Briefly explain.
best-case: the list is given by the order that we want. the only thing to do 
is to sacan the number of the list, the complexity is o(n).
anverage-case: n+1/2n+..=2n,the complexity is o(2n).
worst-case:n+n-1+..=(1+n)n/2=n^2,the complexity is o(n^2).

Debriefing:

1. almost 4 days. Linux enviornment configuration costs me 2 days.
2. difficult. it takes me 1 day to learn professor's python-guide pdf.
3. I did my work absolutely alone in learning and writing python with the help of google searching engine. But i also got some help from my classmates in mac's environment configuration.
4. 90%. I understand the lecture's 80% with professor video's help and 10% from my classmates, though I only understood 50% or less after first class.
5. It's very pleased to see the video. Could you please send some key concepts before class to help me understand ahead? I'll google them before class.
