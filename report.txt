Debriefing:

1. almost 3 days. Linux enviornment costs me almost 2 days.
2. difficult. i'm not familiar with python. maybe only 5% knowledge.
3. I did my work absolutely alone in writing python with the help of google searching engine. But i also got some help from my classmates in mac's environment configuration.
4. I have understood the lecture's 80% content with professor video's help, except Binary Search Tree which I want to ask in office hour but it's conflict with my other class, though after first class I only understood 50% or less.
5. It's very pleased to see the video. I'm in pathway program, but i don't think i can't handle the class. Could you please send some key concepts or materials before class and help me understand ahead? I'll google them before class.
